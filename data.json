      "body": "## Overview\n\n**CRAFT** (Custom Request And Fabrication Tracker) is a modern WPF desktop application for tracking custom fabrication jobs through a multi-department workflow at MAPCO. Built with .NET 8.0 and MVVM architecture, it integrates with Syspro ERP databases to provide real-time job tracking, department routing, and status management.\n\n## Purpose\n\nReplace manual tracking processes for custom fabrication jobs with a centralized system that:\n- Tracks jobs from quote to shipment across SALES, PC (Production Control), and ENGINEERING departments\n- Authenticates users via Windows credentials and maps them to departments based on Syspro GroupCodes\n- Provides audit trails and timeline tracking for all job activities\n- Manages drawing templates and technical documentation for jobs\n- Prevents concurrent editing conflicts with multi-user job locking\n\n## Key Features\n\n### ✅ Completed\n\n#### Core Functionality\n- **Windows Authentication**: Auto-login via domain credentials (Environment.UserName)\n- **Department Mapping**: Automatic department assignment (SALES/PC/ENGINEERING/ADMIN) from Syspro GroupCodes\n- **Database Integration**: Connected to SysproCompanyB (job data) and Sysprodb (employee data)\n- **Employee Caching**: 60-minute cache for performance optimization\n- **MVVM Architecture**: Clean separation of UI and business logic\n\n#### Job Management\n- **Job Workflow Status Transitions**: QUOTE → SOLD → SHIPPED → CANCELED with validation rules (#3)\n- **Drawing Templates Feature**: Complete template library, upload/download, metadata management, search/filter (#4)\n- **Job Filtering and Search**: Filter by status, department, assignee, dates with live search (#7)\n- **Job Notes/Comments**: Collaboration system with timestamps and user attribution (#8)\n- **Database Schema**: Production table/column names finalized and queries updated (#5)\n\n#### Department Features\n- **Department Dashboard Views**: Customized views for SALES, PC, ENGINEERING, and ADMIN users (#9)\n- **Department Handoff Workflow**: Approval/rejection flows between departments\n- **Timeline Tracking**: Visual timeline with alerts for key milestones\n\n#### Multi-User Support\n- **Multi-User Job Locking System**: 3-phase locking prevents concurrent editing conflicts (#13)\n  - Phase 1: Lock acquisition/release with 30-minute expiration\n  - Phase 2: Optimistic concurrency with RowVersion column\n  - Phase 3: Real-time lock monitoring with visual warnings\n- **Test Mode for Department Testing**: Safe testing environment with test users (#14)\n  - Configuration-based user override\n  - Visual test mode indicator (red banner)\n  - Test users for all departments\n\n#### Testing & Quality\n- **Unit Testing Framework**: 75+ passing tests covering converters, services, and models (#12)\n  - xUnit, FluentAssertions, Moq\n  - Converter tests (39), Service tests (22), Model tests (14)\n- **Testing Infrastructure**: Seq logging server on MAPCO-SPARE-DT4 (#11)\n- **CRUD Operations**: Comprehensive end-to-end testing completed (#6)\n\n#### Reporting\n- **Basic Reporting**: Job metrics, completion times, department workload statistics (#10)\n\n### 📋 Planned (Future Enhancements)\n- Export functionality (Excel, PDF reports)\n- Email notifications for job status changes\n- Customer portal for quote status tracking\n- Mobile/web companion app\n- Advanced analytics and forecasting\n\n## Technical Stack\n\n- **Framework**: .NET 8.0-windows\n- **UI**: WPF with XAML\n- **Architecture**: MVVM pattern\n- **Database**: SQL Server (REDWOOD)\n  - Job data: SysproCompanyB (Windows Auth)\n  - Employee data: Sysprodb (SQL Auth)\n- **ORM**: ADO.NET with Dapper\n- **Logging**: Serilog with Seq integration\n- **Testing**: xUnit, FluentAssertions, Moq\n- **Dependencies**: Microsoft.Data.SqlClient, Microsoft.Data.Sqlite\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nCRAFT/\n├── Models/                 # Data models (CustomJob, Employee, etc.)\n├── ViewModels/             # MVVM view models\n├── Views/                  # XAML UI templates\n├── Services/               # Business logic (SqlServerService, EmployeeService)\n├── Helpers/                # Utilities (ObservableObject, RelayCommand)\n├── Converters/             # XAML value converters\n├── Documentation/          # Project docs and guides\n├── MerrittCRAFT.Tests/    # Unit tests (75+ tests)\n└── MerrittCRAFT.IntegrationTests/  # Integration tests\n```\n\n## Current Status\n\n**Version**: v1.0 - Beta  \n**Phase**: Testing & Refinement  \n**Deployment**: Ready for Pilot Testing  \n**Health**: ✅ On Track - All Core Features Complete\n\nSee `Documentation/PROJECT_STATUS.md` for detailed status updates.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Department Workflow\n1. **SALES** creates job (QUOTE status)\n2. **PC** reviews and processes (SOLD status)\n3. **ENGINEERING** designs and approves\n4.
